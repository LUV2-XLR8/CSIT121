      <h1>XML and JavaScript</h1>
      <h2>What is XML?</h2>
      <p>XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language similar to HTML but without predefined tags. Just the fundamental format of XML is standardized. So YOU define the tags needed for your specific project.</p>
      <h2>How is XML used?</h2>
      <p>XML is used in many aspects of web development. XML is often used to separate data from presentation. XML does not carry any information about how to be displayed. The same XML data can be used in many different presentation scenarios. Because of this, with XML, there is a full separation between data and presentation. In many HTML applications, XML is used to store or transport data, while HTML is used to format and display the same data. When displaying data in HTML, you should not have to edit the HTML file when the data changes. With XML, the data can be stored in separate XML files. With a few lines of JavaScript code, you can read an XML file and update the data content of any HTML page.</p>
      <h2>What does XML look like?</h2>
      <p>Here's an example of what XML looks like:</p>
      <p>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br />
          &lt;note&gt;<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;to&gt;Tove&lt;/to&gt;<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;from&gt;Jani&lt;/from&gt;<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;heading&gt;Reminder&lt;/heading&gt;<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;Don't forget me this weekend!&lt;/body&gt;<br />
          &lt;/note&gt;</p>
      <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is an open-source and most popular client-side scripting language supported by all browsers. JavaScript is mainly used for enhancing the interaction of the webpage with users by making it more lively and interactive. It is also used for game development and mobile application development.</p>
      <h2>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS?</h2>
      <p>HTML is used to structure content, CSS is used to style, and JavaScript is used for adding interactions and functions to web pages. JavaScript can interact with both HTML and CSS.</p>
      <h2>What are some common JavaScript elements, properties, methods, and functions?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Elements: &lt;script&gt; - Used to embed JavaScript code in an HTML document</li>
        <li>Properties: document.title - Sets the title of an HTML document</li>
        <li>Methods: alert() - Displays an alert message to the user</li>
        <li>Functions: parseInt() - Converts a string to an integer</li>
      </ul>
