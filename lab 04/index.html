<ul>
	<li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
	<li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
	<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
	<li>1 28 ounce can diced tomatoes</li>
	<li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
	<li>optional: pinch of dried chili flakes</li>
	<li>5 large eggs</li>
	<li>1–2 tbsp freshly chopped parsley</li>
	<li>fresh black pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ol>
	<li>Heat up oil in a 10 inch cast-iron (ideal) or large skillet over med-high heat.</li>
	<li>Sauté onions for 3-5 mins or until translucent.</li>
	<li>Add in garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>
	<li>Add diced tomatoes and spices and bring to a boil then let simmer for <br>about 5 mins or until broth has thickened.</li>
	<li>Create 5 small “wells” for the eggs and crack eggs directly into wells. There should be 4 around the edges and 1 in the middle.</li>
	<li>Cover with a lid, if available or lightly with tin foil and let cook for about 10 mins for over-easy eggs or longer for more well done. Watch closely until desired egg consistency has been reached as each pan/stove top is different.</li>
	<li>Top with fresh parsley and black pepper. Optional to top with feta or goat’s cheese.</li>
	<li>Serve immediately with fresh bread or pita for dipping.</li>
</ol>
